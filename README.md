Explanation of Variables:

v: Represents the number of votes a specific movie has received.
m: Represents the minimum number of votes required for a movie to be included in the recommendation chart or list. This threshold is used to ensure that movies with very few votes are not overly influential in the ranking.
R: Represents the average rating of the movie, typically on a scale of 1 to 10.
C: Represents the average number of votes across all movies in the dataset. This value is used as a baseline for comparison.
